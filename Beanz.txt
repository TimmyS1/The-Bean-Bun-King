It was a dark and stormy night, when the Bean Bun King woke up and found that his precious slices were gone. He could notmake the perfect sandwich,
So he improvised. He instead made pizza sandwich. A sandwich so perfect that it encompasses the perfection of pizza in the form of a sandwich. The kingdom imploded with joy. 
Only the most GLORIOUS king could be capable of such genius. Only the most PERFECT king could put pizza on a bun. Little did they know, that he had not come up with this idea himself.
The last man to question the king had been sentenced to life on Reddit. Nobody dared to questions his authority after that. Not even the kingdom's
biggest redditors thought of such a thing. So, the king's secret was safe. This was until one day, long after he died. Get outta here please thank you google
